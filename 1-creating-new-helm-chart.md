| templates/tests/        | A folder used for grouping different templates. This is strictly for aesthetics and has no effect on how the Helm chart operates – for example, templates/tests is used to group templates that are used for testing. | No                                   |
| values.yaml             | A file that contains the chart’s default values.                                                      | No, but every chart should contain this file as a best practice |

## Installing helm chart using local path 

```shell
helm install guestbook ./guestbook -n guestbook
```

We can check the manifest that got applied
```shell
helm get manifest guestbook -n guestbook
```

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/guestbook 8000:80 -n guestbook

curl localhost:8000
```

Let's cleanup

```shell
helm uninstall guestbook -n guestbook

kubectl delete ns guestbook
```
